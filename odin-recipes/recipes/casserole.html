        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>Brown sugar, in the French toast and in the topping, adds warmth and sweetness.. </li>
            <li>Butter: A stick of butter adds richness and flavor. </li>
            <li>Bread: Choose a sturdy loaf that can stand up to the thick sauce, such as crusty French bread. Some
                reviewers suggest using challah or sourdough.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Six whole eggs are key to the rich, custardy texture.</li>
            <li>Milk: Use whole or 2 percent milk.</li>
            <li>Vanilla: Two teaspoons of vanilla extract enhances the flavor and lends a touch of complexity.</li>
            <li>Cinnamon: A cinnamon-brown sugar mixture is sprinkled over the French toast casserole just before
                baking.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>
                Make the French toast: Cook the butter with a cup of brown sugar until the butter is melted and the
                sugar is dissolved, then pour the mixture into a prepared baking dish. Scatter the bread pieces over the
                butter mixture. Mix the milk, vanilla, and eggs together, then pour over the bread.
            </li>
            <li>Refrigerate: Cover the casserole and transfer to the fridge. Refrigerate at least 8 hours or up to
                overnight.</li>
            <li>Bake the casserole: Remove the casserole from the fridge and uncover. Sprinkle with a mixture of brown
                sugar-cinnamon, then bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is browned and bubbling.</li>
