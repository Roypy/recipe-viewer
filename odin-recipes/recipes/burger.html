        <ol class="ingredients">
            <li>Whisk balsamic vinegar, oil, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Pour over tomato slices to marinate.

            <li>Mix ground beef, tomato paste, basil, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl.
                Form beef mixture into 4 equal patties. </li>
            <li>Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 5
                minutes per side for well done. 
                <br>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
                Top each burger with mozzarella cheese; allow to melt. 
                <br>Serve on hamburger buns with marinated tomato
